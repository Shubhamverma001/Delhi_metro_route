# Delhi_metro_route
In this project, I developed a Delhi Metro shortest route finder using the Dijkstra's algorithm in C++. The aim of this project was to create a program that can calculate the most efficient route between any two metro stations in Delhi, enabling users to navigate the Delhi Metro system conveniently and save time during their commute.
